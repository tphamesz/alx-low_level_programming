Task 0; Write a function that prints a name. Task 1; Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array., where size is the size of the array, and action is a pointer to the function you need to use. Task 2; Write a function that searches for an integer., where size is the number of elements in the array array,cmp is a pointer to the function to be used to compare values, int_index returns the index of the first element for which the cmp function does not return 0, If no element matches, return -1,If size <= 0, return -1. Task 3; Write a program that performs simple operations., You can assume num1 and num2 are integers, so use the atoi function to convert them from the string input to int, operator is one of the following:, +: addition, -: subtraction, *: multiplication, /: division, %: modulo Task 4; Write a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function., Output format:, the opcodes should be printed in hexadecimal, lowercase, each opcode is two char long, listing ends with a new line,see example
